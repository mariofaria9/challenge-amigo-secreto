This software adds, erase, create list and raffle the name of a secret friend.
The current code is part of a challenge from an education partnership between Alura and Oracle.

First of all I created the repository in Github. After, I created the local repository with the main files (app.js, index.html and style.css). Then, I commited and syncronized everything.

Started day 1 creating 4 functions and the main List:

- List : declared "listaAmigos" as an array
- adicionarAmigo() : adds a name into a list;
- limparCampo() : cleans up the input field;
- exibirNome(nome) : shows the name you input at buttons right side;
- apagarLista() : erase all the names in the list;
